I'm a Software Developer currently based in Trinidad and Tobago.
I have a passion for learning how things work and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and workflows.
I'm hoping to use this blog to document my journey as a developer and share some of the things I've learned along the way.
I'm heavily interested in Pokemon, Neovim, and I'm currently learning Go.
